Запомни, у всех злодеев одно общее — проигрыш!
***
Одно знаю точно — девушки не достаются злодеям.
***
В проигрышах тоже есть плюс. Учишься на своих ошибках

— А если Роксана узнает кто ты на самом деле?
— Она никогда не узнает, а тогда зачем иначе врать?
***
Я тебя понимаю, понимаю… Вечная жажда, которую не утолишь… Как я тебя понимаю, элегантно одетая птичка. Пить пустоту и не напиться… Вакуум как в пылесосе. И у тебя пылесос в душе..?
***
Знаешь, чем отличается простой герой от супергероя? Спецэффектами.
***
Даже у судьбы есть любимчики.
***
Выходит, судьба — это не тот путь, который предопределён, а тот, что мы выбираем для себя сами.
***
Какой смысл творить зло, если добро ему не противостоит?

Megamind: Here's my day so far: went to jail, lost the girl of my dreams and got my butt kicked pretty good. Still, things could be a lot worse. Oh, that's right... I'm falling to my death. Guess they can't. How did it all come to this? Well, my end starts at the beginning... The very beginning! 
***
Megamind: This will be the last you ever hear of... Roxanne Ritchi! Huh? 
Metro Man: [gasps] Roxanne! Don't panic, Roxy... I'm on my way! 
Roxanne Ritchi: I'm not panicking. 
Megamind: [smirking] In order to stop me, you'll have to find us first! 
Roxanne Ritchi: We're at the abandoned observatory! 
Megamind: Nooo! We're NOT! Don't listen to her, she's crazy! 
***
Hal: If I were Metro Man, Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time. 
Roxanne Ritchi: Hmmm...? 
Hal: And I'd be watching you, like a dingo watches a human baby!... Okay, that sounded a little creepy... 
Roxanne Ritchi: JUST a little. 
***
Megamind: All men must choose between two paths. Good is the path of honour, heroism, and nobility. Evil... well, it's just cooler. 
***
Megamind: You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi, I'm afraid no one can hear you!... Uh, why isn't she screaming? 
Minion: Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind... 
***
Megamind: Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, shall we? 
***
Minion: Death ray readying! 
Megamind: Let's see if Metro Man can withstand the full concentrated power of the sun! FIRE! 
[nothing happens] 
Megamind: Fire! 
Minion: Still warming up, sir. 
Megamind: Come again? 
Minion: Warming up. 
Megamind: Warming up? The sun is WARMING UP? 
Minion: Just a little more and... 
***
Minion: You seem in a very good mood today, sir. 
Megamind: Huh? Oh, yes... Minion, how long is this going to take? 
Minion: Just a few alterations, and I will be done with your most terrifying cape yet! I'm calling it... The Black Mambaaaaaaaaaa...! 
***
Megamind: Where did you park the invisible car...? 
[walks into it] 
***
[capturing a terrified Hal] 
Megamind: Use the spray! 
[Minion uses a can of chloroform spray, but it doesn't work] 
Minion: [checking the can] All out, sir. 
Megamind: Well, use the forget-me stick! 
Minion: Oh, right! 
***
Titan: [catching Roxanne] What were you saying? I'm sorry, I was too busy saving your life! 
***
Minion: Sir, I think this is a bad idea... 
Megamind: Yes, a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of bad! 
Minion: But I'm saying it's the kind of bad that... Okay, you might think is good from your bad perception, but from a good perception... It's just plain bad. 
Megamind: Oh, you don't know what's good for bad! 
***
Megamind's Father: [last words to his son] You are destined for... 
[the ship closes and takes off] 
Megamind: [voice-over] I hadn't quite heard that last part, but it sounded important. Destined for... What? 
***
Roxanne Ritchi: I knew you'd come back! 
Megamind: Well, that makes one of us... 
***
Megamind: Minion, if I live, I will kill you!
